/**
 * This module deals with Microsoft's heavily modified rendition of the File
 * Allocation Table they called "FATX" that shipped with their Xbox video game
 * console and saw continued use with its successor, the Xbox 360. Notably,
 * this includes dealing with both of their variants, FAT16X and FAT32X.
 *
 * Like FAT32 and VFAT, it too can be considered a continuation of the trend of
 * making FAT FATter, ergo it is "FAT eXtra".
